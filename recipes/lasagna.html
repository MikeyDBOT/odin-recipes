    <h1>The Meat Sauce is basically just like Bolognese. You need:

        Onion, garlic, carrot and celery – for the flavour base, a soffrito;
    
        Beef
    
        Canned tomato and tomato paste
    
        Red wine – for extra flavour!
    
        Seasonings – beef bouillon cubes (stock cubes), bay leaves, thyme, oregano, Worcestershire sauce
    
    For the white sauce, you need:
    
        butter
    
        flour
    
        milk
    
        cheese
    
    For assembling, you need:
    
        lasagna sheets – preferably fresh (from the fridge section of grocery stores) but dried works just fine too
    
        cheese!
